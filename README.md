<h1 align=>Hello! 👋</h1>

I'm Pratik Thengane, a final-year Electronics Engineering student at [G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering](https://ghrce.raisoni.net/), Nagpur, India. 🎓 Throughout my undergraduate journey, I've maintained a strong academic record with a CGPA of 8.5/10.

### 💡 My Passion and Expertise:
I'm passionate about machine learning and computer vision, with a keen interest in applying these technologies to the dynamic field of robotics. 🤖 Eager to leverage the knowledge and skills acquired during my academic pursuits and internships, I am determined to make meaningful contributions to the field of machine learning and robotics.

### 🔭 Research Experience:
🌟 As a Research Intern at [InternPe](https://internpe.in/) (Oct 2023 - Nov 2023), I immersed myself in the field of medical imaging. I developed a deep learning model for early breast cancer detection using mammography images. My work encompassed implementing hybrid thresholding, wavelet transform, and an artificial neural network, followed by rigorous testing and evaluation on benchmark mammogram datasets.

🌟 During my Summer Internship at VedAI Pvt Ltd. (Jun 2022 - Jul 2022), I explored generative models. My project involved implementing a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model for text-to-image synthesis, generating diverse variations of birds and flowers.

### 💖 Giving Back to Society:
In my free time, I volunteer for projects that aim to make a positive impact on society, such as participating in donation drives organized by Anmol Art Foundation. Additionally, I contribute to citizen science projects focused on physical sciences, including the search for asteroids.

### 🌐 Future Endeavors:
I am actively seeking internships and full-time opportunities in the exciting realms of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. 🚀 If you have a suitable opportunity, feel free to contact me at
