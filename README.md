<h1 align=>Hello! 👋</h1>

I am Pratik Thengane, a recent graduate from [G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering](https://ghrce.raisoni.net/), Nagpur, India, where I earned a CGPA of 8.5/10. Currently, I'm working as a research assistant at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/), UK. Where, I am working on efficient audio processing methods using modern architectures like Mamba and xLSTM. These methods replace heavy attention mechanisms, delivering strong performance while reducing computational demands on datasets like AudioSet, VGGSound, and Epic-Sounds.

### 💡 My Passion and Expertise:
I am passionate about advancing the fields of computer vision and machine learning, focusing on developing innovative and efficient solutions across various domains. My interests include generative modeling, such as GANs, diffusion models, and exploring new applications in these areas. My curiosity extends to space science, supported by specialized training with [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/), and I am dedicated to leveraging my skills in Python, C/C++, MATLAB, and frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to drive both technological advancements and social impact 🌍.


### 🔭 Research Experience:
🌟 As a Research Intern at [Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Center (MRSAC)](https://mrsac.gov.in/MRSAC/) Government Of Maharashtra, India (Dec 2023 - Jun 2024), I have worked on developing a facial movements-based HCI that uses a regular webcam to control the mouse cursor by detecting facial landmarks using Eye-Aspect-Ratio (EAR) and Mouth-Aspect-Ratio (MAR).

🌟 As a Research Intern at [InternPe](https://internpe.in/) (Oct 2023 - Nov 2023), I immersed myself in the field of medical imaging. I developed a deep learning model for early breast cancer detection using mammography images. My work encompassed implementing hybrid thresholding, wavelet transform, and an artificial neural network, followed by rigorous testing and evaluation on benchmark mammogram datasets.

🌟 During my Summer Internship at VedAI Pvt Ltd. (Jun 2022 - Jul 2022), I explored generative models. My project involved implementing a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model for text-to-image synthesis, generating diverse variations of birds and flowers.

### 💖 Giving Back to Society:
In my free time, I volunteer for projects that aim to make a positive impact on society, such as participating in donation drives organized by Anmol Art Foundation. Additionally, I contribute to citizen science projects focused on physical sciences, including the search for asteroids.

### 🌐 Future Endeavors:
I am actively seeking internships and full-time opportunities in the exciting realms of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. 🚀 If you have a suitable opportunity, feel free to contact me at
