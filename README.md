### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Pratik Thengane, a passionate and dedicated Electronics Engineering student at [G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering](https://ghrce.raisoni.net/) Nagpur (India). Currently pursuing my B.Tech, I have maintained a strong academic record with a CGPA of 8.48/10. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting and contribute to the field of machine learning. I am particularly interested in opportunities to work on projects that have a positive impact on society.

ðŸ”­ Research Experience:

As a Research Intern at [InternPe](https://internpe.in/) (Oct 2023 - Nov 2023), I delved into the field of medical imaging. My work focused on developing a deep learning model for early breast cancer detection using mammography images. This involved implementing hybrid thresholding, wavelet transform, and an artificial neural network, followed by comprehensive testing and evaluation on benchmark mammogram image datasets.

During my Summer Internship at VedAI Pvt Ltd. (Jun 2022 - Jul 2022), I explored the realm of generative models. My project involved the implementation of a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model for text-to-image synthesis, generating diverse variations of birds and flowers.
